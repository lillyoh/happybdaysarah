			'On celebrating life: “Even though everything is impermanent and like a dream, like a rainbow, like a flash of lightning in a summer cloud. It’s ephemera like a bubble in a stream. At the same time it’s also here. You have tomorrow morning’s sunrise, you have fresh cooked eggs and fresh squeezed orange juice. This is the only place where you can eat baked Alaska. The only place where you can pick up a starfish on a beach and toss it back into the ocean. Isn’t that fantastic.” -Jack Kornfield',
